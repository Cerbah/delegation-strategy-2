## APR (Annual percentage rate)
Percentage growth of the investment (stake account balance) in case rewards are taken out. We estimate the validators' APY for each epoch based on that epoch's duration, cluster's SOL supply, validators' earned credits and stake.

Let:
- $E$ be epochs per year,
-  $I_Y$ be cluster inflation per year,
- $I_{Taper}$ be inflation taper,
- $1 - I_{E}$ be inflation taper per epoch,
- $C_v$ be $v$th validator's commission,
- $S_{Supply}$ be cluster's total supply of SOL,
- $V_{i_{Credits}}$ be credits earned by $i$th validator,
- $V_{i_{Stake}}$ be $i$th validator's active stake,
- $p_v$ be $v$th validator's share of inflation rewards,
- $R_{v{_Y}}$ be inflation rewards generated by the validator in a year,
- $R_{v_{Staker}}$ be inflation rewards shared with the stakers over a year,

then:

$$p_v = \frac{V_{v_{Credits}} \cdot V_{v_{Stake}}}{ \sum_{i} V_{i_{Credits}} \cdot V_{i_{Stake}} }$$

$$I_E = \sqrt[E]{1 - I_{Taper}}$$

$$R_{v{_Y}} = \sum_{e = 0}^{E-1} \frac{I_Y \cdot I_E^e \cdot p_v \cdot S_{Supply}}{E} = \frac{I_Y \cdot p_v \cdot S_{Supply} \cdot I_E^E - 1}{E \cdot (I_E - 1)}$$

$$R_{v_{Staker}} = R_{v{_Y}} \cdot (1 - C_v)$$

$$APR_v = \frac{R_{v_{Staker}}}{V_{v_{Stake}}}$$

Epochs' durations, cluster SOL supply, credits earned by validators, total amount of staked SOL - all of these change throughout the year and therefore it is virtually impossible to accurately project the staking yield. Our calculations are to be considered as mere optimistic estimations.

## APY (Annual percentage yield)
Percentage growth of the investment (stake account balance) over the year given the rewards earned per every epoch are left inside the stake accounts and therefore earn additional rewards. Please note that this is just an estimate (see APR).
Let:
- $APR_v$ be APR of the $v$th validator,
- $E$ be epochs per year,

then:
$$APY_v = (1 + \frac{APR_v}{E})^{E - 1}$$
